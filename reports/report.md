# Security Report
## NIA - National Insecurity Agency
##### Report Version: 61
##### Report ID: 0f2db323-2212-42db-af42-dc3b9f8db748
##### Start date: 30/05/2025
##### End date: 31/05/2025


## Scope
The target for the scan is ensured to be on `172.17.0.2` thanks to an initial mapping done with `nmap 172.17.0.1/24`.

The application is a web application which uses standard web technologies such as **PHP** and **Apache2** web server. However, the application resulted to be vulnerable to many injections which must be taken seriously and solved as soon as possible.

The test conducted was useful for detecting some low level vulnerabilities which are less impactful compared to more important ones such as **SQL Injections** and even **RCE** was achieved through malicious file upload via SQL Injection.

Other minor vulnerabilities have also been found like for example **XSSes** and the missing of security headers. But not only. The application allows also to enumerate users present in the database without rate limiting or blocking the user.

The report will explain each flaw in a detailed way reporting also their **CVSS calculated scores**.

The report also wants to suggest to update the PHP version to a more recent one since a past version `7.2.34` has been used. This version reached **end of life on 2022-11-28** and it is not supported anymore.

##### 1. [RCE] Remote Code Execution via SQL Injection
###### Severity:
Critical
###### Description:
Remote code execution can be best described as an action which involves an attacker executing code remotely using system vulnerabilities. Such code can run from a remote server, which means that the attack can originate from anywhere around the world giving the attacker access to the PC. Once a hacker gains access to a system, theyâ€™ll be able to make changes within the target computer.

##### 2. SQL Injection
###### Severity:
High
###### Description:
SQL Injection is an attack technique used to exploit applications that construct SQL statements from user-supplied input. When successful, the attacker is able to change the logic of SQL statements executed against the database.

Structured Query Language (SQL) is a specialized programming language for sending queries to databases. The SQL programming language is both an ANSI and an ISO standard, though many database products supporting SQL do so with proprietary extensions to the standard language. Applications often use user-supplied data to create SQL statements. If an application fails to properly construct SQL statements it is possible for an attacker to alter the statement structure and execute unplanned and potentially hostile commands. When such commands are executed, they do so under the context of the user specified by the application executing the statement. This capability allows attackers to gain control of all database resources accessible by that user, up to and including the ability to execute commands on the hosting system.

##### 6. [XSS] Cross-site scripting (stored DOM-based)
###### Severity:
Medium
###### Description:
Stored DOM-based vulnerabilities arise when user input is stored and later embedded into a response within a part of the DOM that is then processed in an unsafe way by a client-side script. An attacker can leverage the data storage to control a part of the response (for example, a JavaScript string) that can be used to trigger the DOM-based vulnerability.
DOM-based cross-site scripting arises when a script writes controllable data into the HTML document in an unsafe way. An attacker may be able to use the vulnerability to construct a URL that, if visited by another application user, will cause JavaScript code supplied by the attacker to execute within the user's browser in the context of that user's session with the application.

##### 7. Information Disclosure
###### Severity:
Medium
###### Description:
Information Disclosure refers to a vulnerability where a system unintentionally reveals sensitive or internal information to unauthorized parties. This information may include software versions, configuration details, internal IP addresses, file paths, environment variables, database structure, or even user data. Such disclosures often occur through misconfigurations, verbose error messages, debug pages, or overly detailed response headers.

While not always immediately exploitable on their own, these leaks can significantly aid attackers in reconnaissance, allowing them to map the application or infrastructure, identify potential weak points, and craft more targeted and effective attacks.
###### PoC:
A `phpinfo()` leak is available and shows a lot of reserved information such as environment variables, server path and loaded modules. The page is available under `/debug.php`

-------------


##### 8. Weak Hash Function
###### Severity:
Medium
###### Description:
The application stores user passwords using a weak or outdated hashing algorithm that does not provide adequate resistance against modern cracking techniques. Algorithms such as MD5, SHA-1, or unsalted hashes are considered cryptographically broken or insufficient for secure password storage. These algorithms are fast and lack necessary protections like salting or key stretching, making them highly vulnerable to brute-force attacks, dictionary attacks, and the use of precomputed hash tables (e.g., rainbow tables).

If an attacker gains access to the password database, weakly hashed passwords can be quickly cracked, leading to account compromise and potentially broader security breaches if users reuse passwords across platforms.
###### PoC:
```
+------+-----------------+----------------------------------+
| id   | username        | password                         |

##### 9. Weak admin credentials
###### Severity:
Low
###### Description:
The application or system was found to use easily guessable, weak, or default administrative credentials, such as "admin:admin", "admin:password", or other common username/password combinations. These credentials are widely known and often targeted in automated attacks, brute-force attempts, and credential stuffing campaigns.

Use of predictable or default credentials significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access, especially to high-privilege accounts such as administrative interfaces, control panels, or management dashboards. If successfully exploited, an attacker can gain full control over the application, its data, and underlying systems.
###### PoC:
The admin user `sysadmin` is vulnerable.

##### 10. Missing Security Headers
###### Severity:
Low
###### Description:
The web application does not implement one or more recommended HTTP security headers. Security headers are a critical component of modern web application security, as they instruct the browser on how to behave when handling the site's content. Their absence can leave users and the application vulnerable to a variety of client-side attacks such as cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking, MIME sniffing, and man-in-the-middle attacks.

While the lack of these headers does not always represent an immediate exploitable vulnerability, it significantly weakens the overall security posture of the application and increases exposure to browser-based attacks.
###### PoC:
| Security Header | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| `Clear-Site-Data` | Ensures all site data (cookies, cache, storage, etc.) is cleared, useful on logout or account deletion. |
| `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy` | Controls which origins can load resources, helps prevent data leaks from cross-origin requests. |
| `Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)` | Forces browsers to use HTTPS, protecting against SSL stripping attacks. |
| `Permissions-Policy` | Restricts use of powerful browser features such as geolocation, camera, and microphone. |
| `X-Content-Type-Options` | Prevents MIME-type sniffing which can lead to execution of malicious files. |
| `Referrer-Policy` | Controls how much referrer information is sent with requests, protecting user privacy. |
| `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy` | Ensures resources embedded in the site are secure and isolated. |
| `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy` | Isolates browsing context to improve cross-origin data protection and support COOP/COEP. |
| `Content-Security-Policy (CSP)` | Mitigates XSS by restricting sources of executable scripts and content. |
| `X-Frame-Options` | Protects against clickjacking by preventing the site from being embedded in iframes. |
| `X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies` | Restricts Adobe Flash and Acrobat from loading data from the domain. |

##### 11. [CSRF] Cross-site request forgery
###### Severity:
Low
###### Description:
A cross-site request forgery is an attack that involves forcing a victim to send an HTTP request to a target destination without their knowledge or intent in order to perform an action as the victim. The underlying cause is application functionality using predictable URL/form actions in a repeatable way. The nature of the attack is that CSRF exploits the trust that a web site has for a user. By contrast, cross-site scripting (XSS) [9] exploits the trust that a user has for a web site. Like XSS, CSRF attacks are not necessarily cross-site, but they can be. Cross-site request forgery is also known as CSRF, XSRF, one-click attack, session riding, confused deputy, and sea surf.
###### PoC:
All forms within the application do not use `CSRF` random tokens. As a result, a victim can be tricked into clicking 

Below an example of a `POC` for inducing to create a post from a logged in user.

##### 12. Information disclosure
###### Severity:
Info
###### Description:
The application discloses sensitive information through HTTP response headers, such as the underlying server type, version, framework, or other infrastructure details. Headers like Server, X-Powered-By, or similar can reveal internal components (e.g., Apache/2.4.49, PHP/7.4.3, or Express) that may be associated with known vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.

This form of information disclosure can assist attackers in fingerprinting the system, allowing them to identify outdated or vulnerable software versions and tailor their attacks accordingly. While not directly exploitable on its own, it lowers the overall security posture of the application by aiding in reconnaissance and increasing attack surface visibility.
###### PoC:
All responses contain the following headers

```
Server: Apache/2.4.38 (Debian)
X-Powered-By: PHP/7.2.34
```

Consider to avoid their inclusion in responses

##### 13. Unencrypted communications
###### Severity:
Info
###### Description:
The application allows users to connect to it over unencrypted connections. An attacker suitably positioned to view a legitimate user's network traffic could record and monitor their interactions with the application and obtain any information the user supplies. Furthermore, an attacker able to modify traffic could use the application as a platform for attacks against its users and third-party websites. Unencrypted connections have been exploited by ISPs and governments to track users, and to inject adverts and malicious JavaScript. Due to these concerns, web browser vendors are planning to visually flag unencrypted connections as hazardous.
To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be suitably positioned to eavesdrop on the victim's network traffic. This scenario typically occurs when a client communicates with the server over an insecure connection such as public Wi-Fi, or a corporate or home network that is shared with a compromised computer. Common defenses such as switched networks are not sufficient to prevent this. An attacker situated in the user's ISP or the application's hosting infrastructure could also perform this attack. Note that an advanced adversary could potentially target any connection made over the Internet's core infrastructure.
Please note that using a mixture of encrypted and unencrypted communications is an ineffective defense against active attackers, because they can easily remove references to encrypted resources when these references are transmitted over an unencrypted connection.
###### PoC:
The application uses `http` on port `80` instead of relying on `TLS/SSL`. 
This makes the application vulnerable to MITM attacks.
